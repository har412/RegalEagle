            <h1>Something Smells (Season 2, Episode 2)</h1>
            <p>
                After discovering he’s out of ice cream, SpongeBob makes a sundae with some…odorous ingredients: ketchup, onion and a questionable peanut plant. Upon beginning his Sunday task of greeting every citizen of Bikini Bottom, he realizes he’s not receiving his usual welcome, which Patrick chalks up to his best friend simply being ugly. Predictably, the sea star exacerbates SpongeBob’s anxiety by telling the story of the Ugly Barnacle: “Once there was an ugly barnacle. He was so ugly that everyone died. The end.” Just as quickly, though, Patrick teaches his pal to accept himself, resulting in an extra-memorable scene of the fry cook screaming from the rooftop, “I am ugly and I am proud!” The episode’s already strong script is aided further by the animators’ portrayal of SpongeBob’s breath as a noxious green gas and Tom Kenny’s perfectly breathy performance.
