    <!-- we need to create a box here 
    with one side having an image and other side the content of the box -->

    <!-- 
    How to create a BOX ?
    1. Add a div tag in HTML.
    2. Give class to that HTML Tag
    3. Target the class in the CSS and give it the required properties -->

    <div class="big-box">

                <h3>Sleepy-Time Tom (1951) Would Rather Have A Nap Than A Home</h3>
                <p>Tom spends the entire night performing raucous songs with Meathead, Lightning, and Butch, only returning home at sunrise. Mammy orders him to safeguard the fridge from Jerry even though the cat can barely keep his eyes open. Jerry uses the opportunity to mess with his nemesis by creating a sleep-friendly environment for Tom.
                    <br> <br>
                    By the end of the episode, Mammy catches Tom fast asleep on her bed and instantly kicks him out as promised. Tom doesn't even care anymore at this point, and continues sleeping until his feline pals return for another night of caterwauling.</p>

                <h3>Quiet Please! (1945) Takes On Surreal Proportions Midway Through The Episode</h3>
                <p>An Academy Award winner, Quiet Please! involves the hilarious triplet of Tom, Jerry, and Spike â€” who spends the first half of the episode just trying to get some sleep. This fails because the cat and mouse are in the process of wrecking the house as usual, using everything in their arsenal from frying pans to shotguns.
<br> <br>
                    Unfortunately for Tom, he takes the blame for all the ruckus, leaving Jerry with a malicious plan to blackmail his nemesis with the threat of loud noises. The story takes on surreal proportions when Tom is forced to become an ad-hoc Christmas tree, later proceeding to administer sleeping drugs to Spike, a scheme that turns out exactly as expected.</p>
