                <h2>Treehouse of Horror XXXI</h2>
                <p>(Season 32, Episode 4) <br>
                    The animated series has churned out more than 30 Halloween episodes, paying homage to notable pop
                    culture titles and the spooky. The 2020 episode is the strongest in recent years, as it mixed the
                    more recent (a homage to “Into the Spiderverse” and a short about the election), with the more
                    evergreen (a time loop story and a tribute to “Toy Story”).</p>

                <h2>The Haw-Hawed Couple</h2>
                <p>(Season 18, Episode 8) <br>
                    After Bart encourages his classmates to boycott school bully Nelson’s birthday party, he is forced
                    to attend — and accidentally becomes the young man’s best friend. The episode allows us to see a
                    softer side to Nelson, who gets a little too clingy for Bart’s liking</p>

                <h2>Skinner’s Sense of Snow
                </h2>
                <p>(Season 12, Episode 8) <br>
                    The episode seamlessly balances two extremes: Skinner and the students trapped inside Springfield
                    Elementary with Homer and Ned battling the blizzard to get to the school. There’s fun in seeing the
                    power dynamics flip between Skinner and his students as they rebel against his strict rules for
                    survival, while also watching the frenemies/neighbors drive each other batty in an attempt to get to
                    their kids.</p>

                <h2>A Fish Called Selma</h2>
                <p>(Season 7, Episode 19) <br>
                    After appearing in video clips over the years on the show, has-been actor Troy McClure got his time
                    to shine in this Season 7 episode, as his agent suggested a new romance could kick-start his career.
                    His conquest? Marge’s sister, Selma. Troy didn’t tell her the romance was for PR — rookie mistake —
                    but he was forced to confess after they tied the knot. She reluctantly agreed — until he wanted to
                    bring a baby into the situation. While the marriage didn’t last, Troy’s temporary career resurgence
                    allowed viewers to get a glimpse at the delightfully ridiculous “Planet of the Apes” musical.</p>

                <h2>Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?
                </h2>
                <p>(Season 2, Episode 15) <br>
                    Reuniting with long-lost family can be hit or miss, but for Homer … well, he ruined his
                    half-brother, Herb’s life. (At least temporarily.) When Herb decided to allow his newfound sibling
                    to design a car for the everyman, Homer delivered an iconic masterpiece that was, well, ambitious
                    and a “monstrosity” — which also cost over eighty grand. (It was so memorable, a real version of the
                    car was built.)</p>

                <h2>Deep Space Homer</h2>
                <p>
                    (Season 5, Episode 15)
                    Yes, Homer Simpson went to space. He also caused a temporary panic down on Earth when he broke the
                    shuttle’s ant farm (leading to the memorable Kent Brockman meme, “I, for one, welcome our new insect
                    overlords”) and an inanimate rod got a lot of credit for saving the day.
