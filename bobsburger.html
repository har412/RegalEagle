            <h1>Full Bars</h1>
            <p>
                Halloween costumes are always clever for the Belcher kids, with Louise in this episode dressed as Edward Scissorhands, Tina as a Mommy mummy and Gene as Queen Latifah. Store owners and neighbors in their small town only offer things like deli tickets, oyster crackers and seaweed candy (from school counselor Mr. Frond), so they decide to head out to King’s Head Island, where the residents are richer and are rumored to have full-size candy bars. Louise pulls a prank to get teenagers with pee-filled balloons off their backs. Oh, and Bob kills a guinea pig by accidentally sitting on it in a fat suit.

            <h1>Weekend At Mort’s</h1>
            <p>
                Music is a huge part of the series, with the soundtrack being made into vinyls and at the end of every episode, a song comes on during the ending credits. This time, the gang sings a catchy “Weekend at Mort’s/We’re gonna have a weekend at Mort’s!” The family is excited to spend the weekend at Mort the Mortician’s “It’s Your Funeral Home and Crematorium” because their restaurant is being fumigated. The kids are left alone in the morgue and when Bob comes back drunk from Jimmy Pesto’s, he hops in a satin-covered casket. The kids hear him snoring and think he’s a zombie, thus rolling him into the crematory.
